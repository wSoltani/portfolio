**VIII. Career Context & Motivations (Internal Reference)**

- Current primary engagement via Blueblood with Vantage Labs LLC, while providing significant technical value, operates under a contract structure established 3 years ago with compensation ($3333 USD/month) that is substantially below current market rates for the skillset, experience level, and contractor status (requiring self-coverage of taxes, benefits, PTO).
- Initial onboarding involved ambiguity regarding employee vs. contractor status, leading to the current structure primarily for payment facilitation.
- Motivated to seek opportunities (like Fly.io, Sandfall, or others) that offer compensation aligned with market value, recognize advanced skills (AI/ML, Cloud/Edge), provide benefits/stability, and offer clear paths for professional growth. Also driven by passion for specific domains like game development (Sandfall) or cutting-edge cloud infrastructure (Fly.io).
